We decide on what programs we will do based on what we hear from residents and other student leaders. Each term we strive to put on 6-8 different programs. During the winter and spring term, we also put on a co-program with all three councils. Each executive board member is in charge of putting together at least one program a term.

		<h2>	Portland State is Pretty Great</h2>
<p>

Here at Portland State University, we are a community, we are students, we are Vikings
Portland State University is a campus created by the city, for the city. Portland State is unlike your average University. Portland State was born out of a need for knowledge and a place for community after the old campus was flooded back in 1948. Portland State University wasn’t built from scratch, rather then it was created by the beautiful historical buildings that PSU bought, over time buildings have been built, modernized, students have been enrolling, the funky and eclectic little university grew from one building to over 50 buildings that are affiliated with Portland State. One of the most exciting things about life here at PSU is living on campus and being enriched in everything the city has to offer. Portland State University has 9 different residence halls that offer a wide variety of room options to fit the needs of the different groups of residents we have living here on campus. For example, PSU offers first year floors with all first year students that are taking the same classes, quad units for people who need a little more room, single units for residents who need to live alone, family units for residents that have families, and many other options to fit anyone’s needs. Living, working, and going to school at Portland State University is such a uniquely amazing experience. Living in the heart of downtown Portland, there is an unlimited supply of opportunities, explorations, and friends to make. From everyone at the Residence Hall Association here at PSU, thank you for taking the time to get to know us and our wonderful institution. Let knowledge serve the city and let knowledge serve the PACURH region.
